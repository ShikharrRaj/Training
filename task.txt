Create class called demo
Store object of that class inside arraylist
Perform arraylist operations on that 

task on hash map
        =>create class student
            =>name
            =>rollno
            =>collage
            =>place
            =>branch
            =>some

        class helperClass
           HashMap<String,Student> StudentMap//store all student object inside this map
            =>addStudent()
                =>this help you to create student object take student details add that student object inside HashMap
                using student rollno as key
            =>serchStudet()
                take student rollno as key using search is student is present in map if there print student details
            =>deletestudent()
                take rollno and delete student
        main(){
            while(true){
                switch(case){
                    case 1:addStudent()
                    case 2:serach();
                    case 3 :deletestudent();
                    case 4:exit();
                }
            }
